# SmartSpot
Generating a smart playlist based on favourite taste with great transitions between songs

## Abstract

Pyro from Serato is known for its ability to be an automatic DJ for parties whereas Pyro automatically fades from song to song. Pyro is no longer supported by Spotify since May 7th 2020, hence a possible challenge could be to replicate, if not even improve the application's abilities with additional features in future iterations. Smartspot shall offer these capabilites together with Spotify again. 
### How do you know that a song can be transitioned to another one?

According to different sources, Serato Pyro uses following effects for transitions:

1. Pitch in Time
2. Blending/crossfading similar BPMs
3.
